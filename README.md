# UofT Meal Planner

I use the UofT meal plan, but it was too much effort to plan meals that hit my macros. This site solves that: given desired macros, dietary preferences, and dining locations, it generates a custom menu for each day (by passing that info along with the menu to an LLM). Once setup is done, you just open the site and have a personalized meal plan ready that hits your macros.



## Data Source

Menu and nutritional data is scraped from the [UofT Food Services nutrition portal](https://fso.ueat.utoronto.ca/FSO/ServiceMenuReport/Today).
